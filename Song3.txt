Nice to meet you

Saw you there and I thought 
OMG look at that face 
You look like my next mistake

A e

I can read you like magazine 
Ain't it funny rumours fly and I know you heard about me
so hey! let's be friends and 
I'm dying to see how this one's end 
grab your passports and  my hand.
I can make make the bad boys good for a reason
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames 
you can tell me when it's over 
if the hype was worth the pain

they say I'm insane
but I have got have bad blood baby
and I''ll write your name
