Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin out late , tappin on your window

We were on the phone and we talk real slow 

Coz it's late and your mamma don't know

Our song is the way you laugh 

the first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have 

and when I got home for I said Amen , askin God if he could play that againnnnnnnn

Oh yeahhhh

A a 

--------------------------------------------------------

Walkin in the streets with you and your worn out jeans

I cannot thinking this is how it ought to be 

Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself

Hey! Isn't this easy??

And you got a smile that can light up this whole town 

I haven't seen it in a while since the lockdown is on

You say you're fine , I know you bettter than that

hey what you doin with a girl like that

She wears high heels I wear snickers

She's cheer captain

I'm on the bleachers

*DREAMING ABOUT THE DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND FIND THAT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKIN FOR HAS BEEN HERE THE WHOLE TIME!*

If you can see that Im the one who understands you been here all along so why can't you seee e e

YOU BELONG TO ME

Standing by your ... 

All this time how could you not know baby???

You belong to me
