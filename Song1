Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin out late , tappin on your window

We were on the phone and we talk real slow 

Coz it's late and your mamma don't know

Our song is the way you laugh 

the first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have 

and when I got home for I said Amen , askin God if he could play that againnnnnnnn

Oh yeahhhh

A a
